✅ Step-by-Step - Encrypt a File in OnlineGDB


🔧 Step 1 - Open OnlineGDB
Go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler
Make sure "Java" is selected as the language.


📄 Step 2 - Create input.txt in the Files Panel
    1. On the left side, click on the “Files” panel.
    2. Name the file - input.txt
    3. Inside input.txt, paste this content:
                                            nginx
                                            Copy
                                            Edit
                                            Hello World 123!


🧠 Step 3 - Paste the Java Program in Main.java


▶️ Step 4 - Run the Program
     When prompted in the terminal:

     Choose an option (1 = Encrypt, 2 = Decrypt): 1
     Enter input file name (e.g., input.txt): input.txt
     Enter output file name (e.g., output.txt): output.txt


📂 Step 5 - View output.txt
     After the program completes, go to the Files panel again.
     You’ll see a new file output.txt.
     Click it — you’ll see the encrypted text (characters shifted by +3).
