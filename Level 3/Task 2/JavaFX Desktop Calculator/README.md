# 🧮 JavaFX Calculator App

## 📜 Description

A simple calculator application built using JavaFX for the user interface. This desktop application supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app features a responsive user interface with optional dark mode and includes utility classes for parsing operations and managing calculator states.

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure you have **Java 8** or later installed. 🌟
- You need a properly configured Java Development Kit (JDK) to run the application. 🛠️
- In case of missing dependencies, verify that all required libraries are included in the `lib` folder or declared in the `pom.xml` file. 🔍

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: 
   - Run the application by executing the `MainClass.java` in the `com.calculator.main` package. 🚀

2. **Calculator Interface**:
   - **Numeric Buttons**: Click or input numbers directly to the calculator. 🔢
   - **Operation Buttons**: Choose operations such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`×`), division (`÷`) and more. ➕➖✖️➗
   - **Display**: The main display shows the current input and the result of calculations. 📟
   - **Equals Button**: Compute the result of the current (binary) operation. ✅
   - **Clear and Clear Entry Buttons**: Reset the current input or operation. 🧹
   - **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes for a customized user experience. 🌙

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - **Binary Operations**: Handle operations that involve two numbers (e.g., `5 + 3`). 
   - **Unary Operations**: Execute operations with a single operand (e.g., reciprocal or percentage).
